# HyperionDev-Data-Science-Portfolio
A selection of tasks completed as part of the HyperionDev DfE Data Science Bootcamp.

I was fortunate enough to partcipate in this bootcamp in early 2023. It was an important thing for me to do, and I learned a lot.
With a full time job I successfully completed all the mandatory tasks, some of the optional tasks and graduated successfully. 
Despite this,  there were a number of optional tasks that I did not complete by the end of the course, so I have chosen to complete those in my spare time and upload
them here.

I won't have uploaded the 'Build Your Brand' tasks here as I don't see that as necessary.
